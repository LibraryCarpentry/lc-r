```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../bin/download_data.R")
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("02-")
library(readr)
books <- read_csv("./data/books.csv")
```


## Open your Rproj file

First, open your R Project file (`library_carpentry.Rproj`) created in the `Before We Start` lesson.

If you did not complete that step, do the following:

* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
`New project`
* Enter the name `library_carpentry` for this new folder (or "directory"). This
will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day.
* Click on `Create project`
* Create a new file where we will type our scripts. Go to File > New File > R
script. Click the save icon on your toolbar and save your script as
"`script.R`".


## Presentation of the data

This data was downloaded from the University of Houston--Clear Lake Integrated
Library System in 2018. It is a relatively random sample of books from the
catalog. It consists of 10,000 observations of 11 variables. 

These variables are:

* `CALL...BIBLIO.` : Bibliographic call number. Most of these are cataloged with
the Library of Congress classification, but there are also items cataloged in
the Dewey Decimal System (including fiction and non-fiction), and Superintendent
of Documents call numbers. Character.
* `X245.ab` : The title and remainder of title. Exported from MARC tag 245|ab
fields. Separated by a `|` pipe character. Character.
* `X245.c` : The author (statement of responsibility). Exported from MARC tag 245|c. Character.
* `TOT.CHKOUT` : The total number of checkouts. Integer.
* `LOUTDATE` : The last date the item was checked out. Date. YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD
* `SUBJECT` : Bibliographic subject in Library of Congress Subject Headings.
Separated by a `|` pipe character. Character.
* `ISN` : ISBN or ISSN. Exported from MARC field 020|a. Character
* `CALL...ITEM` : Item call number. Most of these are `NA` but there are some
secondary call numbers.
* `X008.Date.One` : Date of publication. Date. YYYY
* `BCODE2` : Item format. Character.
* `BCODE1` Sub-collection. Character.

## Getting data into R

### Ways to get data into R
In order to use your data in R, you must import it and turn it into an R *object*. There are many ways to get data into R.

* **Manually**: You can manually create it using the `data.frame()` function in Base R, or the `tibble()` function in the tidyverse. 
* **Import it from a file** Below is a very incomplete list
  + Text: TXT (`readLines()` function)
  + Tabular data: CSV, TSV (`read.table()` function or `readr` package)
  + Excel: XLSX (`xlsx` package)
  + Google sheets: (`googlesheets` package)
  + Statistics program: SPSS, SAS (`haven` package)
  + Databases: MySQL (`RMySQL` package)
* **Gather it from the web**: You can connect to webpages, servers, or APIs
directly from within R, or you can create a data scraped from HTML webpages
using the `rvest` package. For example
  - the Twitter API with
  [`twitteR`](https://sites.google.com/site/miningtwitter/questions/talking-about/wordclouds/wordcloud1)
  - Crossref data with
  [`rcrossref`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcrossref/rcrossref.pdf)
  - World Bank's World Development Indicators with
  [`WDI`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WDI/WDI.pdf).

### Organizing your working directory

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized and make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you might
create directories (folders) for **scripts**, **data**, and **documents**. Here
are some examples of suggested directories:

 - **`data/`** Use this folder to store your raw data and intermediate datasets.
 For the sake of transparency and
 [provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance), you should *always*
 keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and
 preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as
 possible.
 - **`data_output/`** When you need to modify your raw data,
   it might be useful to store the modified versions of the datasets in a different folder.
 - **`documents/`** Used for outlines, drafts, and other
   text.
 - **`fig_output/`** This folder can store the graphics that are generated
   by your scripts.
 - **`scripts/`** A place to keep your R scripts for
   different analyses or plotting.

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory.

```{r directory-structure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Structure of a Working Directory, with folders for data, data output, documents, fig output, and scripts"}

```
</figure>

### The working directory

The working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place
on your computer where R will look for and save files. When you write code for
your project, your scripts should refer to files in relation to the root of your working
directory and only to files within this structure.

Using RStudio projects makes this easy and ensures that your working directory
is set up properly. If you need to check it, you can use `getwd()`. If for some
reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the
RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser to where your working directory
should be, clicking on the blue gear icon "More", and selecting "Set As Working
Directory". Alternatively, you can use `setwd("/path/to/working/directory")` to
reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line,
because it will fail on someone else's computer.

> ## Setting your working directory with `setwd()`
>
> Some points to note about setting your working directory:
> 
> The directory must be in quotation marks. 
>
> On Windows computers, directories in file paths are separated with a
backslash `\`. However, in R, you must use a forward slash `/`. You can copy and
paste from the Windows Explorer window directly into R and use find/replace
(Ctrl/Cmd + F) in R Studio to replace all backslashes with forward slashes.
>
> On Mac computers, open the Finder and navigate to the directory you wish to
set as your working directory. Right click on that folder and press the
<kbd>options</kbd> key on your keyboard. The 'Copy "Folder Name"' option will transform into
'Copy "Folder Name" as Pathname. It will copy the path to the folder to the
clipboard. You can then paste this into your `setwd()` function. You do not need
to replace backslashes with forward slashes.
>
> After you set your working directory, you can use `./` to represent it. So if
you have a folder in your directory called `data`, you can use
read.csv("./data") to represent that sub-directory.

### Downloading the data and getting set up

Now that you have set your working directory, we will create our folder
structure using the `dir.create()` function.

For this lesson we will use the following folders in our working directory:
**`data/`**, **`data_output/`** and **`fig_output/`**. Let's write them all in
lowercase to be consistent. We can create them using the RStudio interface by
clicking on the "New Folder" button in the file pane (bottom right), or directly
from R by typing at console:

```{r create-dirs, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("data")
dir.create("data_output")
dir.create("fig_output")
```

Go to the Figshare page for this curriculum and download the dataset called
"`books.csv`". The direct download link is:
<https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/22031487>. Place this downloaded file in
the `data/` you just created. *Alternatively,* you can do this directly from R by copying and
pasting this in your terminal (your instructor can place this chunk of code in
the Etherpad):

```{r download-data, eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/22031487",
              "data/books.csv", mode = "wb")
```

Now if you navigate to your `data` folder, the `books.csv` file should be there.
We now need to load it into our R session.

## `tidyverse`
R has some base functions for reading a local data file into your R
session--namely `read.table()` and `read.csv()`, but these have some
idiosyncrasies that were improved upon in the `readr` package, which is
installed and loaded with `tidyverse`. 

```{r, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # loads the core tidyverse, including dplyr, readr, ggplot2, purrr
```

To get our sample data into our R session, we will use the `read_csv()` function
and assign it to the `books` value.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
books <- read_csv("./data/books.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by each
column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a data file, it
looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and guesses the data type for
each column as it reads it into R. For example, in this dataset, it reads
`SUBJECT` as `col_character` (character), and `TOT.CHKOUT` as `col_double`. You have
the option to specify the data type for a column manually by using the
`col_types` argument in `read_csv`.

You should now have an R object called `books` in the Environment pane: 10000
observations of 12 variables. We will be using this data file in the next
module.

> ## Note
>
> `read_csv()` assumes that fields are delineated by commas, however, in several
> countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is
> used as a field delineator. If you want to read in this type of files in R,
> you can use the `read_csv2` function. It behaves exactly like `read_csv` but
> uses different parameters for the decimal and the field separators. If you are
> working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out
> the help for `read_csv()` by typing `?read_csv` to learn more. There is also
> the `read_tsv()` for tab-separated data files, and `read_delim()` allows you
> to specify more details about the structure of your file.

## What are data frames and tibbles?

Data frames are the _de facto_ data structure for tabular data in `R`, and what 
we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors,
each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

<figure>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A graphical depiction of a data frame. The first vector (column) is numeric; the second is character, and the third is logical."}	
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/data-frame.svg")
```
</figure>

A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the
functions `read_csv()` or `read_table()`; in other words, when importing
spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

A tibble is an extension of `R` data frames used by the _tidyverse_. When the 
data is read using `read_csv()`, it is stored in an object of class `tbl_df`, 
`tbl`,  and `data.frame`. You can see the class of an object with `class()`.


## Inspecting data frames

When calling a `tbl_df` object (like `books` here), there is already a lot of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows, the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this information from data frames.  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these
functions. Let's try them out!

* Size:
  * `dim(books)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
the object)
  * `nrow(books)` - returns the number of rows
  * `ncol(books)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
  * `head(books)` - shows the first 6 rows
  * `tail(books)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
  * `names(books)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for
`data.frame` objects)

* Summary:
  * `View(books)` - look at the data in the viewer
  * `str(books)` - structure of the object and information about the class,
length and content of each column
  * `summary(books)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides data frames.

The `map()` function from `purrr` is a useful way of running a function on all
variables in a data frame or list. If you loaded the `tidyverse` at the
beginning of the session, you also loaded `purrr`. Here we call `class()` on
`books` using `map_chr()`, which will return a character vector of the classes
for each variable.

```{r expl2, comment=NA}
map_chr(books, class)
```


## Indexing and subsetting data frames

Our `books` data frame has 2 dimensions: rows (observations) and columns
(variables). If we want to extract some specific data from it, we need to
specify the "coordinates" we want from it. In the last session, we used square
brackets `[ ]` to subset values from vectors. Here we will do the same thing for
data frames, but we can now add a second dimension. Row numbers come first,
followed by column numbers. However, note that different ways of specifying
these coordinates lead to results with different classes.

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
books[1, 1]
## first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
books[1, 6]
## first column of the data frame (as a vector)
books[[1]]
## first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
books[1]
## first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
books[1:3, 7]
## the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
books[3, ]
## equivalent to head_books <- head(books)
head_books <- books[1:6, ]
```


### Dollar sign
The dollar sign `$` is used to distinguish a specific variable (column, in Excel-speak) in a data frame:
```{r expl1, comment=NA}
head(books$X245.ab)  # print the first six book titles


# print the mean number of checkouts
mean(books$TOT.CHKOUT)
```

### `unique()`, `table()`, and `duplicated()`
Use `unique()` to see all the distinct values in a variable:
```{r expl111, comment=NA}
unique(books$BCODE2)
```

Take that one step further with `table()` to get quick frequency counts on a variable:

```{r expl11, comment=NA}
table(books$BCODE2)  # frequency counts on a variable
```   

You can combine `table()` with relational operators:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
table(books$TOT.CHKOUT > 50)  # how many books have 50 or more checkouts?
```

`duplicated()` will give you the a logical vector of duplicated values.
```{r expl1111, comment=NA, eval=FALSE}
duplicated(books$ISN)  # a TRUE/FALSE vector of duplicated values in the ISN column
!duplicated(books$ISN)  # you can put an exclamation mark before it to get non-duplicated values
table(duplicated(books$ISN))  # run a table of duplicated values
which(duplicated(books$ISN))  # get row numbers of duplicated values
```

## Exploring missing values
You may also need to know the number of missing values:
```{r expl3, comment=NA}
sum(is.na(books))  # How many total missing values?
colSums(is.na(books))  # Total missing values per column
table(is.na(books$ISN))  # use table() and is.na() in combination
booksNoNA <- na.omit(books)  # Return only observations that have no missing values
```

## Logical tests 

R contains a number of operators you can use to compare
values. Use `help(Comparison)` to read the R help file. Note that **two equal
signs** (`==`) are used for evaluating equality (because one equals sign (`=`)
is used for assigning variables).

| operator | function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `<` | Less Than |
| `>` | Greater Than |
| `==` | Equal To |
| `<=` | Less Than or Equal To |
| `>=` | Greater Than or Equal To |
| `!=` | Not Equal To |
| `%in%` | Has a Match In |
| `is.na()` | Is NA |
| `!is.na()` | Is Not NA |

Sometimes you need to do multiple logical tests (think Boolean logic). Use
`help(Logic)` to read the help file.

| operator | function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `&` | boolean AND |
| `|` | boolean OR |
| `!` | Boolean NOT |
| `any()` | Are some values true? |
| `all()` | Are all values true? |
