title: "Data cleaning & transformation with dplyr"
keypoints:
- "Use the `dplyr` package to manipulate dataframes."
- "Use `select()` to choose variables from a dataframe."
- "Use `filter()` to choose data based on values."
- 'Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to work with subsets of data.'
- "Use `mutate()` to create new variables."
objectives:
- "Describe the purpose of an R package and the **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** packages."
- "Select certain columns in a data frame with the **`dplyr`** function `select`."
- "Select certain rows in a data frame according to filtering conditions with the **`dplyr`**  function `filter`."
- "Link the output of one **`dplyr`** function to the input of another function with the 'pipe' operator `%>%`."
- "Add new columns to a data frame that are functions of existing columns with `mutate`."
- "Use the split-apply-combine concept for data analysis."
- "Use `summarize`, `group_by`, and `count` to split a data frame into groups of observations, apply a summary statistics for each group, and then combine the results."
- "Describe the concept of a wide and a long table format and for which purpose those formats are useful."
- "Describe what key-value pairs are."
- "Reshape a data frame from long to wide format and back with the `spread` and `gather` commands from the **`tidyr`** package."
- "Export a data frame to a csv file."
questions:
- "How can I select specific rows and/or columns from a data frame?"
- "How can I combine multiple commands into a single command?"
- "How can create new columns or remove existing columns from a data frame?"
- "How can I reformat a dataframe to meet my needs?"
