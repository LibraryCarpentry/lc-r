This lesson is designed for librarians and library professionals with little or no prior experience with R to be more acquainted with the programming language. Having a level of familiarity with R is beneficial in assisting users with requests regarding the cleaning, formatting, and visualization with data along for librarians and library professionals themselves when it comes to data they intend to use and analyze for their internal workflows.

Learners will become familiar with both R, [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/) software environment, and the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). The R Studio environment allows one to run their code and see the immediate results of one's code separate panels. While R originally started as a being a statistical programming language, R is used for various applications such as data visualization, deploying of web applications, and creating reproducible documentation. Given the extensive applications of R, we will solely be focusing on importing, cleaning, and visualizing data.

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. Describe what R is and use the basic components of the R Studio software environment.
2. Apply functions to import data into R and to format data.
3. Employ functions in the `dplyr` package to perform data cleaning and transformation.
4. Use the `ggplot2` package to create various types of plots and to change aesthetic features of plots.
